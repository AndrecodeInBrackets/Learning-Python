# Before Starting

To install Python on your computer, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/

## But... how do we code?? We need a programming app

I recommend using *PyCharm*. If you don't want to install anything, go use *Replit*. Replit doesn't need The Python installation AT ALL. But replit has the repls public soooooooo. BUT if you are coding from a phone (Which is not recommended AT ALL) then yes, you can use Replit. The downsides of Replit are that you cannot keep stuff private and some things might not work properly
