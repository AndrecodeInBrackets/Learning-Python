# Lesson 1 - Basics

To get started on Python, make a new file. Then, That's it! You just finished the first lesson!  
Just kidding, no that's not it

# Types of values

Values are everything in Python! Values are text, numbers and other. But let's start with the basics:

### String

String is simply just text. To make a string in Python, just surround the text that you want in `''` or `""`. Both work. But I recommend using `""` for better experience.  
If you use `''` make sure that in the string there are NOT any words with `'`. eg: aren't. If there are, Python would not know where you wnat the string to end, so stick with `""`

### Integer (Int)

Integers (for short `int`) are basically numbers with no decimals like `10` or `234`. To make an integer, you don't need to surround the number anyhow. 
> NOTE: Don't try to make integers with text and not numbers. Integers are just `N U M B E R S`

The other type of numbers are called:

### Float

Floats are numbers with decimals. Like int, floats don't need to be surrounded by anything.  
Example of a float: `20.23`

> TIP: Don't forget to NOT use `""` if you want an int or a float. If you want to make an addition operation, use int and/or float not string. If you try and do `"10"+"23"`, it wouldn't give you 33, but 1023.  
> Talking more on that topic later 

## Good Job!
