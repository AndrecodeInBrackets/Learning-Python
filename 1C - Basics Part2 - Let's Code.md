# Lesson 1, Part 2 - Let's Code!

So! You actually Got here! Goooood!

### Before starting
Functions in Python are what the programmer writes to make things work.

## print()

`print()` is the MOST BASIC *function* in Python.  
`print()` *print*s the text that you put between the `()`.
> NOTE: Do Not forget to put `""` to make a string.

Try it for yourself by copying this simple code or writing it by yourself:
```
print("Hello, User! Hello, World!")
```
This is the most easiest thing that YOU can do in Python.  
To print more lines, separately, just use more `print` functions:
```
print("Hello, user")
print("Hello, World")
```
> PRO TIP: To save lines of code, use `\n` to print a new line without using other `print` functions.  
> RISKS OF USING `\n`: `\n` kinda gets the code way too messy. If you are using PyCharm, it will not be hard to ignore the `\n`s

## Other examples
```
print(10 + 10)
```
Output: 20

```
print(100)
```
Output: 100
