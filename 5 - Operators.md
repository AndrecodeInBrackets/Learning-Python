# Lesson 5 - Operators

Operators in Python are the same as in math (almost). The operators are:
- `+` - addition
- `-` - subtraction
- `*` - multiplication
- `/` - division
- `**` - exponentiation
- `//` - floor division
- `%` - modulus
If you already know what these do, then Good Job, you finished the lesson! But if not, let's continue.

## The basic ones
`+` adds 2 numbers and `-` subtracts.  
`*` multiplies a number by another one and `/` divides them.

```python
print(1 + 2)
print(3 - 1)
print(3 * 3)
print(6 / 2)
```

## The more harder ones
`**` means a^b.
`//` divides a number, but if it results into a float it rounds that number down to be an int (7.5 becomes 7)
`%` the modulus gives you the remainder of a division

```python
print(3 ** 3)
print(15 // 2)
print(5 % 2)
```

## Hold up! There's more!
If you want to make an operation with a variable and want to save space, here are some operators for that:
- `+=`
- `-=`
- `*=`
- `/=`
- `**=`
- `//=`
- `%=`
These operators mean this:
### Demo Example:
```python
x = 1
x += 8
print(x)
```
Here, we will print `x` and the console sends `9`. This is because `x += 8` is the same thing as `x = x + 8`. This rule applies for every `[sign]=` operator.
> NOTE: First put the operator and then the equal. See the pattern?
