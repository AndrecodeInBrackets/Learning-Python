# Lesson 6 - Comments
# This one's short!

Comments in python help programmers know what parts of a code do and don't do anything to the code! They are just aesthetic codeblocks!

# How to Make Comments?
To make a comment in your Python file, use `#` and then put a space (to be readable) and then write everything you want.  
Another thing comments can do is canceling a code line!

```python
# This is a comment!
```
To cancel a code line you just get this chunk of code:

```python
var = "Crazzy"
print("Crazzy")
print(var)
```
And then put a `#` where you don't want code to work anymore but still want to have it:
```python
var = "Crazzy"
#print("Crazzy")
print(var)
```

## Great!
You finished this lesson!  
```python
exp = 5
exp += 1
ptint(exp)
```
