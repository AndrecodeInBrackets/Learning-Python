# Lesson 7 - Loops -- Part 2 - For Loops
`for` Loops are loops that repeat things a surtain amount of time. `range` is the most basic function of a `for` loop. Let's see how to construct a `for` loop with `range`:
### Building a for loop

```py
for i in range(5):
  print(i)
```
This code counts from 0 to 4. Let's try from 1 to 5!
```py
for i in range(5):
  print(i+1)
```
### Lists in for loops

Now let's use a list. Lists will be covered in the next lesson.
```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "pineapple"]

for fruit in friuts:
  print(fruit)
```
For short, a list is like a variable that stores multiple values. You make a list surrounding the values with brackets (`[]`) (or square brackets). Lists are usually plural.  
This code will print the values from the list.

## How to read a for loop
To read a for loop out loud you just read it like this: For every `i` (`i` is the counter) in the range of `num`...  
Or: For every `i` in list...

## Good Job!
You finished this lesson!
```py
for experienceLevel in range(7)
  print(i+1)
```
