# Before Starting

Before Starting the journey, you need a programming app that you can use.
I recommend using *PyCharm*. If you don't want to install anything, go use *Replit*. But replit has the repls public soooooooo. BUT if you are coding from a phone (Which is not recommended AT ALL) then yes, you can use Replit. The downsides of Replit are that you cannot keep stuff private and some things might not work properlly
